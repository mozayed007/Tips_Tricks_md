# SponsorBlock: A Professional Guide

SponsorBlock is a browser extension that helps users skip sponsored segments in YouTube videos. It uses a public and continuously updated database to identify timestamps when sponsor messages occur and automatically skips these segments [ghacks.net](https://www.ghacks.net/2020/01/03/skip-sponsor-messages-in-youtube-videos-with-sponsorblock/).

## 1. Install SponsorBlock

Install the SponsorBlock browser extension for your preferred browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Opera) from the [SponsorBlock website](https://sponsor.ajay.app/).

## 2. Automatic Skipping

Once installed, SponsorBlock automatically skips sponsored segments in YouTube videos based on the timestamps provided by the public database [ghacks.net](https://www.ghacks.net/2020/01/03/skip-sponsor-messages-in-youtube-videos-with-sponsorblock/).

## 3. User Feedback

SponsorBlock relies on user feedback to update its database. Users can contribute by submitting timestamps of sponsored segments in videos, which helps improve the accuracy and effectiveness of the extension [ghacks.net](https://www.ghacks.net/2020/01/03/skip-sponsor-messages-in-youtube-videos-with-sponsorblock/).

## 4. Different from uBlock Origin

SponsorBlock is designed specifically for skipping sponsored segments in YouTube videos, while uBlock Origin is a more general content blocker. Although both extensions improve the browsing experience, they serve different purposes and can be used together for optimal results [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/uBlockOrigin/comments/mlehvv/sponsorblock_and_ublock_origin/).
