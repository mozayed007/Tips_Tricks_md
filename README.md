      tmux, or terminal multiplexer, is a command-line tool that allows users to manage and switch between multiple terminal sessions efficiently. It provides features like splitting terminal windows, navigating between panes, and sharing sessions with other users. tmux is particularly useful for remote work, as it enables users to reattach to running sessions if their SSH connection drops, ensuring that their work continues without interruption.
